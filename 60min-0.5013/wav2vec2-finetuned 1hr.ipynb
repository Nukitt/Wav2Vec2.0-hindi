are actually legal for ',\n"," 'the heap so if we have a heap h which is implemented as a python list though the list ',\n"," 'will allow an append function the append function on it is own does not insert a value ',\n"," 'and maintain the heap property so in general the call such as h dot append 7 would not ',\n"," 'be legal ',\n"," 'so we want to define new abstract data types in terms of the

want the actual operations ',\n"," 'that we define as the abstract interface to be permitted ',\n"," 'for instance if we have a stack s and we push value v then the property of a stack guarantees ',\n"," 'that if we immediately apply pop the value we get back is our last value push and therefore ',\n"," 'we should get back v in other words if we execute this sequence we first to s dot push ',\n"," 'and then we do a pop then the value that we pushed must be the value that we get back ',\n"," 'this is a way of abstractly defining the property of a stack and how push and pop interact without ',\n"," 'actually telling us anything about how the internal values are represented in the same ',\n"," 'way if we have an empty queue and we add to it two elements u and v and then we remove ',\n"," 'the head of the queue then we expect that we started with an empty queue and then we ',\n"," 'put in from this end u and then we put in a v then the element that comes out should ',\n"," 'be the first element namely u in other words assuming that this is empty then if we add ',\n"," 'u and add v and then remove the head we should get back first element that we put in namely ',\n"," 'u the important thing is that we would like ',\n"," 'to define the behavior of a data type without reference to the implementation now this ',\n"," 'can be very tedious because you have to make sure that it capture all the properties between ',\n"," 'functions but this can be done and this is technically how an abstract data type is defined ',\n"," 'now large purposes we will normally define it more

change ',\n"," 'one implementation to another one such that the functions behave the same way and the ',\n"," 'outside user has no idea which implementation is used now this is often the case when we ',\n"," 'need to optimize implementation we might come up with an inefficient implementation ',\n"," 'and then optimize it for instance we saw that for a priority queue we could actually ',\n"," 'implement it as a sorted list and then we could implement insert as an insert operation ',\n"," 'in a sorted list which you take order n time but delete max would just remove the head ',\n"," 'of the list this is not optimal because over a sequence ',\n"," 'of n inserts and deletes this takes time order n square so if we replace the internal implementation ',\n"," 'from a sorted list to a heap we get better behavior but in terms of the actual values ',\n"," 'that the user sees as a sequence of inserts and delete max the user does not see any difference ',\n"," 'between the sorted list implementation and the heap implementation perhaps there is ',\n"," 'a perception that the one is faster than the other but the actual correctness of the implementation ',\n"," 'should not be affected by how you choose to represent the data so this is the essence ',\n"," 'of defining an abstract datatype ',\n"," 'so good way to think of an abstract datatype is as a black box which allows limited interaction ',\n"," 'imagine something like an atm machine so we have the data structure as a black box ',\n"," 'and we have certain buttons which are the public interface these are the functions ',\n"," 'that we are allowed to use in this picture imagine this is a stack and the buttons were ',\n"," 'allowed to push are pop and push let they are allowed to remove the top elements from ',\n"," 'the stack they are allowed to put an element into the stack ',\n"," 'now this requires us to also add and view things from the stack so we also have a slot ',\n"," 'for input which is shown as a kind of a thing at the bottom here we have the slot for input ',\n"," 'and we have the way to receive information about the state of the stack so we can imagine ',\n"," 'that we have some kind of a display this is typically how we would like to think ',\n"," 'of a data structure we do not want to know what is inside the black box we just want ',\n"," 'to specify that if we do a sequence of button pushes and we start supplying input through ',\n"," 'the input box what do we expect to see if the display other than this no other manipulation ',\n"," 'should be allowed we are not allowed to exploit what is inside the box in order to quickly ',\n"," 'get access say to the middle of a stack or the middle of a queue so we do not want such ',\n"," 'operations we only want those operations which the externally visible interface or ',\n"," 'the buttons in this case of the black box picture allow us to use ',\n"," 'in a sense this is already implemented when we use the built in data types of python ',\n"," 'if we announce that the name l is of type list by setting l to the empty list then immediately ',\n"," 'python will allow us to use operations like append and extend on this list but because ',\n"," 'it is of list type and not dictionary type we would not be able to execute an operations ',\n"," 'such as keys which is defined for dictionaries are not list ',\n"," 'likewise if we define d to be an empty dictionary then we can use a function such as d dot values ',\n"," 'to get the list of values currently stored but we cannot manipulate d as a list so ',\n"," 'we cannot say d dot append it will give us an error python uses the type information ',\n"," 'that it has about the value give assign to a name to determine what functions are legal ',\n"," 'which is exactly what we are trying to do with these abstract data types we are trying ',\n"," 'to say that the data type on it is own should allow only certain limited types of access ',\n"," 'whose behavior is specified without telling us anything about the internal implementation ',\n"," 'remember for instance we saw that in a dictionary even if we add a sequence or values in the ',\n"," 'particular order we ask for the values after sometime they may not written in the same ',\n"," 'order because internally there is some optimization in order to make it fast to look up a value ',\n"," 'for it we have no idea actually how dictionaries implemented inside but what we do know is ',\n"," 'that if we provide a key and that key is a valid key we will get the associated with ',\n"," 'that key we do not ask how this is done and we do not know whether from one version of ',\n"," 'python to the next the way in which this is implemented changes ',\n"," 'our question is that instead of using the built in list for stacks queues and heaps ',\n"," 'and other data structures can we also defined a data type in which certain operations are ',\n"," 'permitted according to the type that we start with ',\n"," 'this is one of the main things which are associated with a style of programming called object ',\n"," 'oriented program in object oriented program we can provide data type definitions for new ',\n"," 'data types in which we do precisely what we have been talking about we describe the public ',\n"," 'interface that is the operations that are allowed on the data and separately we provide ',\n"," 'an implementation which should be private we will discuss later that in python we do ',\n"," 'not actually have a full notion of privacy because of the nature of the language ',\n"," 'but ideally the implementation should not be visible outside only the interface should ',\n"," 'allow the user to interact with the implemented data of course the implementation must be ',\n"," 'such that the functions that are visible to the user behave correctly ',\n"," 'so here for instance if we had a heap the public interface would say insert and delete ',\n"," 'max the private implementation may be a sorted list or it may be a heap and then we would ',\n"," 'then have to ensure that if we are using a sorted list we implement delete max and insert ',\n"," 'in the correct way and if we switch from that to a heap the priority queue operations remain ',\n"," 'the same ',\n"," 'in the terminology of object oriented programming there are two important concepts classes ',\n"," 'and objects a class is a template very much like a function definition is a template ',\n"," 'when we say def and define a function the function does not execute it just gives us ',\n"," 'a blue print saying that this is what would happen if this function were called with a ',\n"," 'particular argument and that argument to be substituted for the formal parameter in the ',\n"," 'function and the code in the function will be execute to the corresponding value ',\n"," 'in the same way a class sets up a blue print or a template for a data type it tells us ',\n"," 'two things it tells us what is the internal implementation how is data stored and it ',\n"," 'gives us the functions that are used to implement the actual public interface so how you manipulate ',\n"," 'the internal data in order to effect the operations that the public interface allows now once ',\n"," 'we have this template we can construct many instances of it so you have the blue print ',\n"," 'for a stack you can construct many independent stacks each independent stack has it is own ',\n"," 'data that stacks do not interfere with each other ',\n"," 'each of them has a copy of the function that we have defined associated with it rather ',\n"," 'than the kind of the main difference from classical programming is in classical programming ',\n"," 'you would have for instance a function like say push define and it will have two parameters ',\n"," 'typically a stack and a value so you have one function and then you provide it the stack ',\n"," 'that you want to manipulate on the other hand now we have several stacks ',\n"," 's1 s2 s3 etcetera which are created as instance as class and logically each of them ',\n"," 'has it is own push function so there is a push associated with s1 that the push associated ',\n"," 'is s2 the push associated with s3 and so on each of them is a copy of the same function ',\n"," 'derived from this template but this implicitly attach to the single object so this is just ',\n"," 'a slight difference in perspective instead of having a function to which you pass the ',\n"," 'object that you want to manipulate you have the object and you tell it what function to ',\n"," 'apply to itself so let us look at a kind of example this ',\n"," 'would not be a detailed example it will just give you a flavor of what we are talking about ',\n"," 'here is a skeleton of a definition of a class heap so now we instead of using the built ',\n"," 'in list we want to define our own data type heap so there are some function definitions ',\n"," 'these def statements and these correspond to definition in the functions and what we ',\n"," 'will see is that inside these definitions we will have values which are stored in each ',\n"," 'copy of the heap so just to get a little bit of an idea about how this is would work ',\n"," 'when we create on object of type heap we call it like a function so we say h is equal ',\n"," 'to heap l so this implicitly says give me an instance of the class heap with the initially ',\n"," 'value l passed to it now this calls this function init which is why it is called init so init ',\n"," 'is what is called a constructor a constructor is a function that is called when the object ',\n"," 'is created and sets it up initially in this particular case our constructor is presumed ',\n"," 'to take an arbitrary list of values say 14 32 15 and heapify it so somewhere inside ',\n"," 'the code of init there will be a heapification operation which we are not actually shown ',\n"," 'in this slide this is how you create objects you first ',\n"," 'define a class we will look at a complete example soon we define a class and then you ',\n"," 'call the class sort of like a function and the name that is attach to this function call ',\n"," 'or this class were becomes a new object as we said we have functions like insert and ',\n"," 'delete max define for heaps but it is like we have the separate copy of this function ',\n"," 'for each individual heaps in this case we are created a heap h so we ',\n"," 'want to tell h insert in yourself the value 70 so we write that as insert with respect ',\n"," 'to h so h dot insert 17 as suppose to insert h 17 which would be the normal functional ',\n"," 'style of writings we would normally pass it the heap and the value here instead we ',\n"," 'say given the heap h apply to the heap h the function insert with the argument 70 ',\n"," 'the next line says apply to the heap h in function insert to the value 28 and then for ',\n"," 'instance we can now ask h to return the maximum value by it is an h dot delete max and store ',\n"," 'the return value in the main v ',\n"," 'so what we would like to emphasize is that an abstract data type should be seen as a ',\n"," 'black box like a black box has a public interface the buttons that you can push to update and ',\n"," 'query the data type to add things delete things and find out what whether the data ',\n"," 'type is empty and so on inside we have a private implementation this actually stores ',\n"," 'data in some particular way to make the public functions work correctly but the important ',\n"," 'thing is changing the private implementation should not affect how the functions behave ',\n"," 'in terms of input and output they may behave differently in terms of efficiency ',\n"," 'you might see that one version is faster than another or one version slower than another ',\n"," 'but this is not the same as saying that the functions change so we do not want the values ',\n"," 'to change if we have a priority queue and we insert a set of values and then delete ',\n"," 'max no matter how the priority queue is actually implemented internally the delete max should ',\n"," 'give us the same value at the end so we saw that python supports object oriented ',\n"," 'programming we shall look at it in more detail in the next couple of lectures in these weeks ',\n"," 'course but the main concept associated with this objected oriented programming are classes ',\n"," 'and objects classes are templates for data types and objects are instances of these classes ',\n"," 'they have a concrete data types which we use in our program  ',\n"," 'welcome to the first lecture on the course on programming data structures and algorithm ',\n"," 'in python ',\n"," \"let's start with the basic definition of what we mean by an algorithm and what programming \",\n"," 'is as most of you probably know an algorithm is a description of how to systematically ',\n"," 'perform some task an algorithm consists of a sequence of steps which can we think of ',\n"," 'as a recipe in order to achieve something so the word recipe of course comes from ',\n"," 'cooking where we have list of ingredients and then a sequence of steps to prepare a ',\n"," 'dish so in the same way an algorithm is a way to prepare something or to achieve a ',\n"," 'given task so in the context of our thing a recipe will is what we call a program and ',\n"," 'we write down a program using a programming language so the goal of programming language ',\n"," 'is to be able to describe the sequence of steps that are required and to also describe ',\n"," 'how we might pursue different sequences of steps if different things happen in between ',\n"," 'the notion of a step is something that can be performed by whatever is executing the ',\n"," 'algorithm now a program need not be executed by a machine although that will the typical ',\n"," 'context of computer programming were we expect a computer to execute our steps a program ',\n"," 'could also be executed by a person for instance supposing the task at hand is to prepare a ',\n"," 'hall for a function so this will consists of different steps such as a cleaning the ',\n"," 'room preparing the stage making sure the decoration are up arranging the chairs and ',\n"," 'so on this will be executed by a team of people now depending on the expertise and ',\n"," 'the experience of this group of people you can describe this algorithm at different levels ',\n"," 'of detail for instance an instruction such as arrange ',\n"," 'the chair would makes sense if the people involved know exactly what is expected on ',\n"," 'the other hand if this is a new group of people who have never done this before you ',\n"," 'might need to describe to step in more detail for instance you might want to say that arrange ',\n"," 'the chairs in the 8 rows and put 10 chairs in each row so the notion of a step is subjective ',\n"," 'it depends on what we expect of the person or the machine which is executing the algorithm ',\n"," 'and in terms of that capability we describe the algorithm itself ',\n"," 'our focus in this course is going to be on computer algorithms and typically these algorithms ',\n"," 'manipulate information the most basic kind of algorithm that all of us are familiar with ',\n"," 'from high school is an algorithm that computes numerical functions for instance we could ',\n"," 'have an algorithm which takes two numbers x and y and computes x to the power y so ',\n"," 'we have seen any number of such functions in school ',\n"," 'for example to compute square root of x so what we do in school is we have complicated ',\n"," 'way to compute square root of x or we might have x divided by y where we do long division ',\n"," 'and so on these are all algorithms which compute values given one or more numbers they ',\n"," 'compute the output of this function ',\n"," 'but all of us who have used computers know that many other things also fall within the ',\n"," 'realm of computation for instance if we use a spreadsheet to arrange information and ',\n"," 'then we want to sort of column so this involves rearranging the items in the column in some ',\n"," 'order either in ascending order or descending order so reorganizing information is also ',\n"," 'a computational task and we need to know how to do this algorithmically we also see computation ',\n"," 'around us in the day todayâ€™s life for instance when we go to a travel booking site and we ',\n"," 'try to book a flight from one city to another city it will offer to arrange the flights ',\n"," 'in terms of the minimum time or the minimum cost so these are optimization problems ',\n"," 'this involves also arranging information in a particular way and then computing some quantity ',\n"," 'that we desire in this case we want to know that a we can ',\n"," 'get from a to b and b among all the ways we can get from a to b we want the optimum ',\n"," 'one and of course there are many many more things that we see day today which are executed ',\n"," 'by computer programs we can play games for instance we can solve sudoku or we can play ',\n"," 'chess against a program when we use the word processor to type a document or even when ',\n"," 'we use our cell phones to type sms messages the computer suggests correction in our spelling ',\n"," 'we will look at some of these things in this course but the point is to note that a program ',\n"," 'in our context is anything that looks at information and manipulates it to a given requirement ',\n"," 'so it is not only a question of taking a number in and putting the number out it could ',\n"," 'involve rearranging things it could involve computing more complicated things it could ',\n"," 'involve organizing the information in a particular ways so these computations become more tractable ',\n"," 'and that is what we call a data structure ',\n"," 'so to illustrate this let us look at the function which most of us have seen and try to understand ',\n"," 'the algorithmically so the property that i want to compute is the greatest common decide ',\n"," 'divisor of two positive integers m and n so as we know a divisor is a number that ',\n"," 'divides so k is a divisor of m if i can divide m by k and get no reminder so the ',\n"," 'greatest common divisor of m and n must be something which is a common divisor so common ',\n"," 'means it must divide both and it must be the largest of these so if the largest k such ',\n"," 'that k divides m and k also divides m for instance if we look at the number 8 and ',\n"," '12 then we can see that 4 is the factor of 8 4 is the divisor of 8 4 is also divisor ',\n"," 'of 12 another divisor of 12 is 6 but 6 is not a divisor of 8 so if we go through the ',\n"," 'divisors of 8 and twelve it is easy to check that the largest number that divides both ',\n"," '8 and 12 is 4 so gcd of 8 and 12 is 4 what about 18 and 25 25 is 5 by 5 so it has ',\n"," 'only one divisor other than 1 and 25 which is 5 and 5 is not a divisor of 18 but fortunately ',\n"," '1 is a divisor of 18 so we can say that gcd of 18 and 25 is 1 there is no number ',\n"," 'bigger than 1 that divides both 18 and 25 since 1 divides every number as we saw in ',\n"," 'the case of 18 and 25 there will always be at least one common divisor among the two ',\n"," 'numbers the gcd will always be well defined it will ',\n"," 'never be that we cannot find the common divisor and because all the common divisors will be ',\n"," 'numbers we can arrange them from smallest to largest and pick the largest one as the ',\n"," 'greatest common divisor so given any pair of positive number m and n we can definitely ',\n"," 'compute the gcd of these two numbers ',\n"," 'so how would one go about computing gcd of m n so this is where we come to the algorithmic ',\n"," 'way we want to describe the uniform way of systematically computing gcd of m n for any ',\n"," 'm or any n so here is a very simple procedure it is not the most efficient we will see ',\n"," 'better once as we go along but if we just look at the definition of gcd it says look ',\n"," 'at all the factors of m look at all the factor of n and find the largest one which is the ',\n"," 'factor of both so the naive way to do this would be first list out factors of m then ',\n"," 'list out all the factor of second number n and then among these two lists report the ',\n"," 'largest number that appears in both lists this is almost literally the definition of ',\n"," 'gcd now question is does this constitute an algorithm ',\n"," 'well at a high level of detail if we think of list out factors as a single step what ',\n"," 'we want from an algorithm are two things one is that the description of what to do ',\n"," 'must be written down in a finite way in the sense that i should be able to write down ',\n"," 'the instruction regardless of the value m and n in such a way it can read it and comprehend ',\n"," 'it once and for all here is very clear we have exactly three ',\n"," 'steps right so we have three steps at constitute the algorithm so it certainly presented in ',\n"," 'a finite way the other requirement of an algorithm is that we must get the answer after ',\n"," 'a finite number of steps of this finite number of steps may be different for different values ',\n"," 'of m and n you can imagine that if you have a very small number for n there are not many ',\n"," 'factors they are the very large number for n you might have many factors so the process ',\n"," 'of listing out the factors of m and n may take a long time however we want to be guaranteed ',\n"," 'that this process will always end and then having done this we will always able to find ',\n"," 'the largest number that appears in both lists ',\n"," 'to argue that this process is well defined all we need to realize is that the factors ',\n"," 'of m must be between 1 and m in other words we although there are infinitely many different ',\n"," \"possibility as factors we don't have to look at any number bigger than m because it cannot \",\n"," 'go into m evenly so all we need to do to compute the factors of m is to test every ',\n"," 'number is range one to m and if it divides m without a reminder then we add it to list ',\n"," 'of factors so we start with empty list of factors and we consider it on 1 2 3 4 up ',\n"," 'to m and for each such number we check whether if we divide m by this number we get a reminder ',\n"," 'of 0 we get a reminder of 0 we add it to the list ',\n"," 'let us look at the concrete example let us try to compute the gcd of 14 and 63 so the ',\n"," 'first step in our algorithm says to compute the factors of 14 so by our observation ',\n"," 'above the factors of 14 must lie between one and 14 nothing bigger than 14 can be a factor ',\n"," 'so we start a listing our all the possible factors between one and 14 and testing them ',\n"," 'so we know of course that 1 will always divide in this case 2 divides 14 because ',\n"," '14 dived by 2 is 7 with no remainder now 3 does not divide 4 does not divide 5 does ',\n"," 'not divide 6 does not divide but 7 does because if we divide 14 by 7 we get a remainder ',\n"," 'of 0 then again 8 does not divide nine does not divide and so on ',\n"," 'and finally we find that the only other factor left is 14 itself so for every number m  1 ',\n"," 'and m will be factors and then there may be factors in between ',\n"," 'so having done this we have identified that factors of 14 and these factors are precisely ',\n"," 'the 1 2 7 and 14 ',\n"," 'the next step in computing the gcd of 14 and 63 is to compute the factors of 63 so in ',\n"," 'the same way we write down the all the numbers from one to 63 and we check which ones divide ',\n"," 'so again we will find that 1 divides here 2 does not divide because 63 is not even ',\n"," '3 does divides then we find a bunch of numbers here which do not divide then we find that ',\n"," \"7 divides because 7 9's are 63 then again 8 does not divides but 9 does then again \",\n"," 'there are large gap of numbers which do not divide and then 21 does divide because 21 ',\n"," \"3's are 63 and then finally we find that the last factor that we have is 63 so if \",\n"," 'we go through this systematically from one to 63 crossing out each number which is not ',\n"," 'a factor we end up with the list 1 3 7 9 21 and 63 ',\n"," 'having computed the factors of the two numbers 14 and 63 the next step in our algorithm says ',\n"," 'that we must find the largest factor that appears in both list so how do we do this ',\n"," 'how do we construct a list of common factors now there are more clever ways to do this ',\n"," 'but here is a very simple way we just go through one of the lists say the list of factors ',\n"," 'of 14 and for each item in the list we check it is a factor of 63 ',\n"," 'so we start with 1 and we say does 1 appear as a factor of 63 it does so we add to the ',\n"," 'list of common factors then we look at 2 then we ask does it appear it does not appear ',\n"," 'so we skip it then we look at 3 and look at 7 rather and we find that 7 does appear ',\n"," 'so we add 7 then finally we look at 14 and find that 14 does not appears so we skip it ',\n"," 'in this way we have systematically gone through 1 2 7 and 14 and concluded that of these ',\n"," 'only 1 and 7 appear in both list and now having done this we have a list of ',\n"," 'all the common factors we computed them from smallest to biggest because we went to the ',\n"," 'factors of 14 in ascending order so this list will also be in ascending order so ',\n"," 'returning the largest factors just returns the right most factor in this list namely ',\n"," '7 this is the output of our function we have computed the factors of 14 computed ',\n"," 'the factors of 63 systematically checked for every factor of 14 whether it is also ',\n"," 'a factor of 63 and computed the list of common factors here and then from this list we have ',\n"," 'extracted the largest one and this in fact is our gcd this is an example of how this ',\n"," 'algorithm would execute ',\n"," 'if you have to write it down in little more detail then we could say that we need to ',\n"," 'notice that we need to remember these lists right and then come back to them so we ',\n"," 'need to compute the factors of 14 keep it side we need to write it down somewhere we ',\n"," 'need to compute the factor of 63 write it down somewhere and then compare these two ',\n"," 'lists so in other words we need to assign some names to store these let us call fm ',\n"," 'for factors of m and fn factors of n as the names of these lists so what we do is that ',\n"," 'we run through the numbers one to m and for each i in this list 1 to m we check whether ',\n"," 'i divide m whether m divided by i as reminder 0 and if so we add it to the list factors ',\n"," 'of m or fm similarly for each j from 1 to n we check whether j divides n and if so ',\n"," 'we add it to the list fn now we have two lists fm and fn which are ',\n"," 'the factors of m and factors of n now we want to compute the list of common factors ',\n"," 'which we will call cf so what we do is for every f that is a factor of a first number ',\n"," 'remember in our case was 14 where each f so we ran through 1 2 7 and 14 in our case ',\n"," 'right so for each f is list we add f to the list of the common factors if it also ',\n"," 'appears in the other list so in the other list if you number is 1 3 7 9 21 and 63 ',\n"," 'so we compare f with this list and if we find it we add it to cf ',\n"," 'and having done this now we want to return the largest value of the list of common factors ',\n"," 'remember that one will always be a common factor so the list cf will not be empty ',\n"," 'there will be at least one value but since we add them in ascending order since the list ',\n"," 'fm and fn where constructed from 1 to m and 1 to n the largest value will also be the ',\n"," 'right most value this gives us a slightly more detailed algorithm for gcd it is more ',\n"," 'or less same as previous one except spells out little more details how to compute the ',\n"," 'list of factors of m and how to compute the list of factors of n and how to compute the ',\n"," 'largest of common factor between these two lists so earlier we had three abstract statements ',\n"," 'now we are expanded out into 6 slightly more detailed statements ',\n"," 'this already gives us enough information to write our first python program of course ',\n"," 'we will need to learn little more before we know how to write it but we can certainly ',\n"," 'figure out how to read it so what this python programming is doing is exactly what we described ',\n"," 'informally in the previous step the first thing in the python program is a line which ',\n"," 'defines the function so we are defining a function gcd of m comma n so m and n are ',\n"," \"the two arguments which could be any number like any function it's like when we read \",\n"," 'f of x y in mathematics it means x and y are arbitrator values and for every x and y do ',\n"," 'something depending on the values that we a call the function with so this says that ',\n"," 'this is a definition so def for definition of a function gcd m n ',\n"," 'now the first step is to compute the list of factors of m in python we write a list ',\n"," 'using square brackets so list is written as x y z and so on so the empty list is ',\n"," 'just an open bracket and a square close bracket so we start off with an empty list of factors ',\n"," 'so this equality means assign a value so we assign fm the list of factors of m to be ',\n"," 'the empty list now we need to test every value in the range 1 to n ',\n"," 'now python has a built in function called range but because of we shall see because ',\n"," 'of peculiarity of python this returns not the range you except but one less so if ',\n"," 'i say give the numbers in the range 1 to n plus 1 it gives me in the range one to m ',\n"," 'one up to the upper limit but not including the upper limit so this will say that i ',\n"," 'takes the values one two three up to m for each of these values of i we check whether ',\n"," 'this is true now percentage is the remainder operation ',\n"," 'it checks whether remainder of m divided by i is 0 if the remainder of m divided by i ',\n"," 'is 0 then we will append i to the list fn we will add it to the right append is the ',\n"," 'english word which just means add to the end of the list so we append i to n so in ',\n"," 'this step we have computed fm this is exactly what we wrote informally in the previous example ',\n"," 'we just said that for each i from 1 to m add i to fm if i divides m and now we have done ',\n"," 'it in python syntax so we have defined an empty list of factors and for each number ',\n"," 'in that range we have checked it is a divisor and then add it ',\n"," 'and now here we do the exactly the same thing for n so we start with the empty list of ',\n"," 'factors of n for every j in for this range if it divides we append it now at this point ',\n"," 'we have two list fm and fn now we want to compute the list of common factors so we ',\n"," 'use cf to denote the list of common factors initially there are no common factors now ',\n"," 'for every factor in the first list if the factor appears in the second list then we ',\n"," 'append it to cf so the same function append is being use ',\n"," 'throughout just take a list and add a value which value we add the value that we are ',\n"," 'looking at now provided it satisfies the conditions so earlier we were adding provided the divisor ',\n"," 'was 0 uh the remainder was 0 now we are adding it provided it appears in both list for every ',\n"," 'f in the first list if it appears in the second list add it ',\n"," 'after this we have computed fm cf and now we want the right most element so this is ',\n"," 'just some python syntax if you see which says that instead of if we start counting from ',\n"," 'the left then the number the positions in the list are number 0 1 2 3 and 4 but ',\n"," 'python has a shortcut which says that you want to count from the right then we count ',\n"," \"the numbers as minus 1 minus 2 and so on so it says return the minus 1'th element \",\n"," 'of cf which in python jargon means return the right most element so this is the right ',\n"," 'most element at this point it is enough to understand that ',\n"," 'we can actually try and decode this code this program even though we may not understand ',\n"," 'exactly why we are using colon in some places and why we are pushing something see notice ',\n"," 'that are other syntactic things here so there are for example you have these punctuation ',\n"," 'marks which are a bit odd like these colons then you have the fact that this line is indented ',\n"," 'with respect to this line this line is indented to this line ',\n"," 'these are all features that make python programs a little easier to read and write then programs ',\n"," 'in other languages so we will come to these when we learn python syntax more formally ',\n"," 'but at this point you should be able to convince yourself that this set of python steps is ',\n"," 'a very faithful rendering of the informal algorithm that we wrote in the previous slide ',\n"," 'let us note some points that we can already deduce from this particular example so the ',\n"," 'first important point is that we need a way to keep track of intermediate values so ',\n"," 'we have two names to begin with the names of our arguments m and n then we use these ',\n"," 'three names to compute this list of factors and common factors and we use other names ',\n"," 'like i j and f in order to run through these we need i to run from 1 to n we need j to ',\n"," 'run from 1 to n of course we could reuse i but it is okay we use f to run through ',\n"," 'all the factors in cf so these are all ways of keeping track of intermediate values the ',\n"," 'second point to note is that a value can be a single item ',\n"," 'for example m n are numbers similarly i j and f at each step are numbers so these ',\n"," 'will be single values or they could be collections so there are lists so fm is a list fn is ',\n"," 'a list so it is a single name denoting a collection of values in this case a list a ',\n"," 'sequence has a first position and next position and a last position these are list of numbers ',\n"," 'one can imagine the other collections and we will see them as we go along so collections ',\n"," 'are important because it would be very difficult to write a program if we had to keep producing ',\n"," 'a name for every factor of m separately we need a name collectively for all the factors ',\n"," 'of m regardless of how big m is these names can denote can be denote single values or ',\n"," 'collections of values and a collection of values with the particular structure is precisely ',\n"," 'what we call data structure so these are more generally called data structures so ',\n"," 'in this case the data structure we have is a list ',\n"," 'what can we do with these names and values well one thing is we can assigned a value ',\n"," 'to a name so for instance when we write fn is equal to the empty list we are explicitly ',\n"," 'setting the value of fn to be the empty list this tells two things this says the value ',\n"," 'is empyt list so it is also tells python the fn denotes the lists these are the two ',\n"," 'steps going on here as we see and the other part is that when we write something ',\n"," 'like for each f in the list cf which is implicitly saying that take every value in cf and assign ',\n"," 'it one by one to the values f to the name f right though they do not have this equality ',\n"," 'sign explicitly implicitly this is assigning the new values for f as we step the list cf ',\n"," 'right so the main thing that we do in a python program is to assign values to names ',\n"," 'and having assigned a value we can then modify the value for instance every time we find ',\n"," 'a new factor of n we do not want to through any old factor we want to take the existing ',\n"," 'list fm and we want to add it so this function append for instance modifies the value of ',\n"," 'the name fn to a new name which takes the old name and sticks an i at the end of it ',\n"," 'more generally you could have a number and we could want a replaces by two times a number ',\n"," 'so we might have something like i is equal to two times i so star stands for multiplication ',\n"," 'this does not mean that i is equals to two times i arithmetically because obviously ',\n"," 'unless i is 0 i cannot be equal to two times itself what is means is that take the current ',\n"," 'value of i multiply it by two and assign it to i so we will see this as we go along ',\n"," 'but assignment can either assign a completely new value or you could update the value using ',\n"," 'the old value so here we taking the old value of the function of the list fn and we ',\n"," 'are appending a value it would getting a new value of fn ',\n"," 'the other part that we are need to note is how we execute steps so we said at the beginning ',\n"," \"of today's lecture a program is a sequence of steps but we do not just execute the sequence \",\n"," 'of steps from beginning to end blindly sometimes we have to do the same thing again and again ',\n"," 'for instance we have to check for every possible factor from 1 to m if it divides m and then ',\n"," 'put it in the list so some steps are repeated we do something for examples here for each ',\n"," 'item in a list and some steps are executed only if the value ',\n"," 'that we are looking at meets particular conditions when we say something like if m percent i ',\n"," 'is 0 if the remainder of m divided by a is 0 then append so the step append i to fm ',\n"," 'the factors of m this happens only if i matches the condition that it is a factor of m so ',\n"," 'we have repeated steps where same thing done again and again and they have conditionals ',\n"," 'steps something which is done only if a particular condition holds ',\n"," 'so we will stop here these examples should show you that programs are not very different ',\n"," 'from what we know intuitively it is only a question of writing them down correctly ',\n"," 'and making sure that we keep track of all the intermediate values and steps that we ',\n"," 'need as we long so that we do not lose things we will look at this example in more detail ',\n"," 'as we go long and try to find other ways of writing it and examine other features ',\n"," 'but essentially this is a good way of illustrating programming  ',\n"," 'we have seen several situations where we want to store a sequence of values ',\n"," 'now it turns out that in a program or in a programming language implementation there ',\n"," 'are two basic ways in which we can store such a sequence ',\n"," 'these are normally called arrays and lists ',\n"," 'so let us look at the difference between arrays and lists ',\n"," 'an array is usually a sequence which is stored as a single block in memory ',\n"," 'so you can imagine if you wish that your memory is arranged in certain way and then ',\n"," 'you have an array so usually memories arranged in what are called words ',\n"," 'word is one unit of what you can store or retrieve from memory and an array will usually ',\n"," 'be one continuous block without any gaps ',\n"," 'and in particular this would apply when an array has only a single type of value so ',\n"," 'all the elements in the sequence are either integers or floats or something where the ',\n"," 'length of each element of the array is of a uniform size ',\n"," 'we would also typically in an array no in advance how big this block is ',\n"," 'so we might know that it has say 100 entry so we have a sequence of size 100 ',\n"," 'now when this happens what happens is that if you want to look at the jth element of ',\n"," 'a sequence or the ith element of a sequence then what you want to think of is this block ',\n"," 'of memory starting with 1 2 3 up to i right and you want to get to the ith element quickly ',\n"," 'but since everything is of a uniform size and you know where this starts we know where ',\n"," 'the sequence starts you can just compute i times this size of one unit and quickly go ',\n"," 'and one shot to the location in the memory where the ith element is saved ',\n"," 'so accessing the ith element of an array just requires arithmetic computation of the ',\n"," 'address by starting with the initial point of the array and then walking forward i units ',\n"," 'to the ith position ',\n"," 'and this can be done in what we could call constant time ',\n"," 'by constant time what we mean is it does not really depend on i ',\n"," 'it is no easier or no difficult to get the last element of an array as it is to get to ',\n"," 'the second element of an array it is independent of i ',\n"," 'it takes the fixed amount of time to get to sequence of y for any i ',\n"," 'now one consequence of this is inserting or contracting arrays is expensive because ',\n"," 'now if i have an array with 0 to 99 and i want to add a new value here say at position ',\n"," 'i then first of all this array now becomes from 0 to 100 and now everything which is ',\n"," 'after i has to be shifted to accommodate space if we want to keep the same representation ',\n"," 'with the entire array is stored as a single block ',\n"," 'so when we have a single block of memory though it is efficient to get to any part ',\n"," 'of it quickly it is not very efficient to expand it because we have to then shift everything ',\n"," 'the worst case for example if this green block comes into 0th position then the entire ',\n"," 'array has to be shifted down by one position ',\n"," 'in the same way contraction is also expensive because we have to make a hole in some sense ',\n"," 'if we remove this element out then we have a hole here and then we have to push everything ',\n"," 'up to block this hole because â€“ remember the array must have all elements contiguous ',\n"," 'that is without any gaps starting from the initial position ',\n"," 'the other way of storing a sequence is to store it one element at a time and not bother ',\n"," 'about how these elements are with respect to each other in the memory ',\n"," 'i can think of this memory as a large space and now i might have one element here so ',\n"," 'this is my first element and then i will have a way of saying that from here the next element ',\n"," 'is somewhere else this is what we call a link ',\n"," 'so very often in the implementation these are called linked list so i may have the ',\n"," 'first element here ',\n"," 'now because of various reasons i might end up putting the second element here and so ',\n"," 'on ',\n"," 'you can imagine that if you have some say space in your cupboard and then you take out ',\n"," 'things and then you put things back but you put things back in the first place where you ',\n"," 'have an empty slot then the sequence in which you put thinks back may not respect the sequence ',\n"," 'in which they appear finally in the shelf ',\n"," 'so here in the same way we do not have any physical assumption about how these elements ',\n"," 'are stored we just have a logical link from the first element to the next element and ',\n"," 'so on ',\n"," 'the other part of this is that we do not have to worry about the overall length of the list ',\n"," 'because we know we started at the 0th position and we keep walking down ',\n"," 'on the last position so say suppose the last position is in fact two then there would be ',\n"," 'some indication here saying that there is no next element so two is the last element ',\n"," 'a list can have a flexible size and obviously because we are just pointing one element to ',\n"," 'another we can also accommodate what we see in python where each element of the list maybe ',\n"," 'of a different type and hence each value might have a different size in itself ',\n"," 'it is not important unlike an array that all the values have exactly the same size because ',\n"," 'we want to compute how many values to skip to get to the ith element ',\n"," 'here we are not skipping we are just walking down these links ',\n"," 'since we have to follow these links the only way to find out where the ith element is is ',\n"," 'to start from the 0th element and then go to the first element then go to the second ',\n"," 'element and so on because a priori we have no idea where the ith element is ',\n"," 'so after i steps we will reach the ith element ',\n"," 'and if we have a larger value of i it takes longer to get there ',\n"," 'so accessing the ith position in a sequence when the sequence is stored as a list takes ',\n"," 'time proportional to i we cannot assume that we can reach any position in the list in constant ',\n"," 'time unlike in an array ',\n"," 'on the other hand it is relatively easy to either insert or delete an element in a list ',\n"," 'like this ',\n"," 'supposing we have a list like this ',\n"," 'suppose we start at 0th position and may come to the ith position and currently if ',\n"," 'we say that the ith position points to the i plus 1th position which point to the rest ',\n"," 'and suppose we want to insert something here then it is quite simple we just say that this ',\n"," 'is the new i plus 1th position ',\n"," 'we create a new block in memory to store this value and then we will make this point here ',\n"," 'so it is like plumbing we remove one pipe and we attach a pipe from the ith element ',\n"," 'to the new element and attach another pipe to the new element to what was beyond the ',\n"," 'ith element previously ',\n"," 'we just have to shift these three links around and this does not matter wherever we have ',\n"," 'to do it any place in the list if we have i have just have to make this local change ',\n"," 'in these links ',\n"," 'and so this insertion becomes now a constant time operation if we already are at the position ',\n"," 'where we want to make the change ',\n"," 'in the same way if we want to delete something that is also easy in fact it is even easier ',\n"," 'so i have say i pointing to i plus 1 pointing to i plus 2 and i want to remove this element ',\n"," 'well then i just make this link directly point to the next one ',\n"," 'remember all these links are available to us we know this link we know this link so ',\n"," 'we know where i plus second element is ',\n"," 'similarly here when we want to create a new element we get a link for it because we create ',\n"," 'it and we know what link to copy there because we already have it here ',\n"," 'so we can copy it from the ith element to the new element ',\n"," 'therefore in a list it is expensive to get to the ith element it takes time proportional ',\n"," 'to the position we are trying to get to however having got to a position inserting or deleting ',\n"," 'an element at that position is of constant time ',\n"," 'unlike in an array where if we insert or delete at some position we have to shift a ',\n"," 'lot of values forwards or back words and that takes time ',\n"," 'let us look at typical operations that we perform on sequences ',\n"," 'so one typical operation now if i just represent a sequence more abstractly as sequences we ',\n"," 'have been drawing it ',\n"," 'supposing i want to exchange the values at i and j ',\n"," 'this would take constant time in an array because we know that we can get the value ',\n"," 'at ith position get the value at the jth position in constant time independent of i ',\n"," 'and j and then we exchange them it just involves coping this there and the other one back ',\n"," 'on the other hand in a list i have to first walk down to the ith position and then walk ',\n"," 'down to the jth position to get the two positions so i will have in a list i would have the ',\n"," 'sequence of links and then i would have another sequence of links ',\n"," 'then having now identified the block where the ith value is and the block where the jth ',\n"," 'values then i can of cause exchange them without actually changing the structure i just copy ',\n"," 'the values back and forth but to find the ith and jth values it takes time proportional ',\n"," 'to i and j so it takes linear time ',\n"," 'on the other hand as we have already seen if you want to delete the value at position ',\n"," 'i or insert the value after position i this we can do efficiently in a list because we ',\n"," 'just have to shift some links around whereas in an array we have to do some shifting of ',\n"," 'a large bunch of values before or after the thing and that requires us to take time proportional ',\n"," 'to i ',\n"," 'the consequence of these differences between the two representations of a sequence as an ',\n"," 'array and a list is that we have to be careful to think about how algorithms that we want ',\n"," 'to design for sequences apply depending on how the sequence is actually represented ',\n"," 'an algorithm which works efficiently for a list may or may not work efficiently for an ',\n"," 'array and vice versa ',\n"," 'to illustrate this let us look at something which you are probably familiar with at least ',\n"," 'informally called binary search ',\n"," 'the problem we are interested in is to find out whether a value v is present in a collection ',\n"," 'or we can even call it a sequence to be we more precise in a sequence which we call seq ',\n"," 'so we have a sequence of values we want to check whether a given value is there or not ',\n"," 'for instance we might be looking at the list of roll numbers of people who have been selected ',\n"," 'for a program you want to check whether our roll number is there or not ',\n"," 'there are two questions that we want to ask one is is it important whether the sequence ',\n"," 'is maintained as an array or as a list and is it also important given that it is maintained ',\n"," 'as an array or a list whether or not there is some additional information we know for ',\n"," 'example it is useful for array to be sorted in ascending order that is all the elements ',\n"," 'go in strictly one sequence from beginning to end lowest to highest or highest to lowest ',\n"," 'or does it matter does it not matter at all ',\n"," 'here is a very simple python program to search for a value in a unsorted sequence ',\n"," 'this is a similar to what we saw before where we are looking for the position of the first ',\n"," 'position of a value in a sequence which is we not we do not even need the position we ',\n"," 'only need true or false is it there or is it not it is a very simple thing ',\n"," 'what we do is we loop through all the elements in the sequence and check whether any element ',\n"," 'is the value that we are looking for ',\n"," 'once we have found it we can exit so this exits the function with the value true ',\n"," 'and if we have succeeded in going through the entire list but we have not exited with ',\n"," 'true that means we have not found the thing so we can unambiguously say after the for ',\n"," 'that we have reached this point we have not found the value v that we are looking for ',\n"," 'and so we should return false ',\n"," 'since we are not looking for the position we have much simpler code if you go back and ',\n"," 'see the code we wrote for findpos so there we had first of all keep track of the position ',\n"," 'and check the value at position i rather than the value itself ',\n"," 'and secondly when we finish the loop we had to determine whether or not we had found it ',\n"," 'or we had not found it whether we had remember we use the break to get out of the loop for ',\n"," 'the first time we found it ',\n"," 'we used to detect whether we broke or not if we did not have a break then we had found ',\n"," 'it if we did not had a break we did not find it ',\n"," 'accordingly either the value of pause was set or it was not set and if it is not set ',\n"," 'we should make it minus 1 ',\n"," 'so that was more complicated this is very simple ',\n"," 'the main point of this function is that we have no solution to search other than to scan ',\n"," 'from beginning to end ',\n"," 'the only systematic way to find out v occurs in the sequence or not is to start at the ',\n"," 'beginning and go till the end and check every value because we do not have any idea where ',\n"," 'this value might be ',\n"," 'this will take time in general proportional to the length of the sequence ',\n"," 'we are typically interested in how long this function would take in the worst case ',\n"," 'so what is the worst case ',\n"," 'well of cause one worst case is if we find the value at the end of the list ',\n"," 'so v is the last value then we have to look at all ',\n"," 'but more generally v is not in the list ',\n"," 'v is not in the list the only way we can determine the v is not in the list is to check every ',\n"," 'value and determine that that value is not found ',\n"," 'and this property that we have to scan the entire sequence and therefore we have to take ',\n"," 'time proportional to the sequence to determine whether v is in the sequence or not it does ',\n"," 'not matter if the sequence is an array or a list whether it is an array or a list we ',\n"," 'have to systematically go through every value the organization of the information does not ',\n"," 'matter ',\n"," 'what matters is the fact that there is no additional structure to the information the ',\n"," 'information is not sorted in any way at no point can we give up and say that since we ',\n"," 'have not seen it so far we are not going to see it later ',\n"," 'on the other hand if we have a sorted sequence we have a procedure which would be at least ',\n"," 'informally familiar with you ',\n"," 'when we search for a word in a dictionary for example the dictionary is sorted by alphabetical ',\n"," 'order of words ',\n"," 'if we are looking for a word and if we open a page at random supposing we are looking ',\n"," 'for the word monkey and we open the dictionary at a page where the values or the word start ',\n"," 'with i then we know that m comes after i in the dictionary order of the english alphabet ',\n"," 'so we need to only search in the second half of the dictionary after i we do not have ',\n"," 'to look at any word before i ',\n"," 'in general if we have a sequence that efficient way to search for this value is to first look ',\n"," 'at the middle value so we are looking for v so we check what happens here ',\n"," 'so there are three cases either we have found it in which ways which case we are good if ',\n"," 'we have not found it we compare the value we are looking for with what we see over there ',\n"," 'if the value we are looking for is smaller than the value we see over there it must ',\n"," 'be in this half ',\n"," 'on the other hand if the value we are looking for is bigger it must be in this half ',\n"," 'so we can halve the amount of space to search and we can be sure that the half we are not ',\n"," 'going to look at positively does not have the value because we are assuming that this ',\n"," 'sequence is sorted ',\n"," 'this is called binary search ',\n"," 'this is also for example what you do when you play game like twenty questions if you ',\n"," 'play that when somebody ask you to guess the name of a person they are thinking of then ',\n"," 'you might first ask the question whether the person is female if the person is female ',\n"," 'then the persons and their answer is yes then you only need to think about women if the ',\n"," 'person says no then you only need to think about m so we have men ',\n"," 'so you have half number of people in your imagination we have to think about ',\n"," 'at each point each question then further splits into two groups depending on whether the answer ',\n"," 'is  yes or no ',\n"," 'here is some python code for binary search ',\n"," 'so binary search in general will start with the entire list and then as we said it look ',\n"," 'at the midpoint and decide on the left so we will have to again perform binary search ',\n"," 'on this ',\n"," 'how would we do that ',\n"," 'again we will look at the midpoint of this part then we are again look at say the midpoint ',\n"," 'of the next part that we look at and so on ',\n"," 'in general binary search is trying to do a binary search for a value in some segment ',\n"," 'of the list ',\n"," 'so we will demarcate that segment using l and r ',\n"," 'so we are looking for this slice sequence starting with l and going to r minus 1 we ',\n"," 'are assuming that sequence is sorted and we are looking for v there ',\n"," 'first of all if the slice is empty so this says the slice is empty that is we have gone ',\n"," 'halving the thing and we have eventually run out of values to look at ',\n"," 'the last thing we look at was the slice of length 1 and we divided it into 2 and we got ',\n"," 'a select of slice of length 0 ',\n"," 'then we can say that we have not found it yet so we are not going to ever find it and ',\n"," 'we return false ',\n"," 'on the other hand if the slice is not empty then what we do is we first compute the midpoint ',\n"," 'an easy way to compute the point is to use this integer division operation ',\n"," 'supposing we are have currently the slice from 4 to 7 then at the next point we will ',\n"," 'take 11 by 2 integer wise and we will go to 5 ',\n"," 'remember 4 5 6 7 ',\n"," 'we could either choose 6 or 7 then next to split it into two parts because we are going ',\n"," 'to examine 6 and then look at 4 5 and 7 or look at 5 and then 4 7 ',\n"," 'if we do integer division then we will pick the smaller output ',\n"," 'so we find the midpoint ',\n"," 'now we check whether the value is the value at that midpoint if so we return true if ',\n"," 'it is not then we check whether the smaller if so we continue our search from the existing ',\n"," 'left point till the left of the midpoint ',\n"," 'now we are using this python think that this is actually means this is a slice up to mid ',\n"," 'and therefore it stops at mid minus 1 ',\n"," 'so it will not again look at the value we just examined ',\n"," 'it will look at everything strictly to its left ',\n"," 'if the value that we are looking for is not the value with the midpoint and it is smaller ',\n"," 'than the midpoint look to the left otherwise you look strictly to the right you start ',\n"," 'at mid plus one and go up to the current right line ',\n"," 'this is a recursive function ',\n"," 'it will keep doing this at each point the interval will half so eventually supposing ',\n"," 'we have a slice of the form just one value so 5 to 6 for example then at the next point ',\n"," 'right we will end up having to look at just a slice from 5 to 5 or 6 to 6 and this will ',\n"," 'give us a slice which is empty because we will find at the right point at the left point ',\n"," 'are the same ',\n"," 'so how long does the binary search algorithm take ',\n"," 'the key point is that each step halves the interval that we are searching and if we have ',\n"," 'an empty interval we get an immediate answer ',\n"," 'so the usual way we do this is to record the time taken depending on the size of the ',\n"," 'sequence or the array or the list so we have written array here but it would be sequence ',\n"," 'in general ',\n"," 'if the sequence has length 0 then it takes only one step because we just report that ',\n"," 'it is false we cannot find it if there are no elements left ',\n"," 'otherwise we have to examine the midpoint so that takes one abstract step you know computing ',\n"," 'the midpoint and checking whether the value is we will collapse at all into one abstract ',\n"," 'step ',\n"," 'and then depending on the answer remember we are computing worst case the answer in ',\n"," 'the worst case is when it is going to be found in the sequence ',\n"," 'so the worst case it will not be the midpoint we will have to look at half the sequence ',\n"," 'we will have to again solve a binary search for a new list which is half the length of ',\n"," 'the old list so the time taken for n elements is 1 plus the time taken for n by 2 elements ',\n"," 'we want an expression for t of n which satisfies so this is what is called a recurrence normally ',\n"," 'what function t of n would satisfy this ',\n"," 'one way to do that is just keep substituting and see what happens ',\n"," 'we start unwinding as itself so we have this by the same recurrence should be 1 plus ',\n"," 't of n by 4 because i take this and halve it ',\n"," 'so t of n is 1 plus 1 plus t of n by 4 ',\n"," 'so we start with 1 plus t of n by 2 and i expand this ',\n"," 'then i get 1 plus 1 plus t of n by 2 squared and in this case i will again get 1 plus 1 ',\n"," 'plus 1 by t of n by 2 cube ',\n"," 'in general after k steps we will have 1 plus 1 plus 1 k plus 1 times or k times and t of ',\n"," 'n by 2 to the k ',\n"," 'now when do we stop ',\n"," 'we stop when we actually get t of 0 or we can also say that for t of 1 it takes one ',\n"," 'step just we want to be careful ',\n"," 'so when this expression becomes 1 so when n is equal to 2 to the k ',\n"," 'so when is n equal to 2 to the k this is precisely the definition of log right ',\n"," 'how many times do i have to multiply 2 by itself in order to get n and that is the ',\n"," 'value of k that we want ',\n"," 'after log n steps this term will turn out to be 1 ',\n"," 'we will end up with roughly log n times 1 added up and so we will get log n steps ',\n"," 'so what we are saying is really if we start with the 1000 values in the next step we ',\n"," 'will end up searching 500 next step 250 next step 125 next step 62 and so on ',\n"," 'and if we keep doing this when will we get to a trivial sequence of length 0 or 1 ',\n"," 'well be keep dividing 1000 by 2 how many times can we divide 1000 by 2 that is precisely ',\n"," 'the log of 1000 to the base 2 and that is an equivalent definition of log ',\n"," 'this comes back to another point ',\n"," 'now we have said that if we had a sorted sequence of values we can do this clever binary search ',\n"," 'but remember that it requires as to jump in and compute mid which is fine and we need ',\n"," 'to then look at the value at the midpoint and we are assuming that this computation ',\n"," 'of mid and comparing the value of the midpoint to constant amount of time that is why we ',\n"," 'said that it is 1 plus t n by 2 this 1 involves computing mid and looking up the frequency ',\n"," 'at the midpoint ',\n"," 'but this can only be done for arrays because only for arrays can we take a position and ',\n"," 'jump in and get the value at that position in constant time it will not work for lists ',\n"," 'because we need to look up the sequence at the ith position in constant time ',\n"," 'of course one important and probably not so obvious thing if you think about binary ',\n"," 'search is that by only looking at a very small number of values say for example we give ',\n"," 'you a sorted list of 1000 entries as i said if a value is not there we only have to search ',\n"," '10 possible entries because we keep having after log n which is about to remember the ',\n"," '2 to the 10 is 1024 right two times two times two ten times is 1024 ',\n"," 'after 10 halvings of 1000 we would have come down to 0 or 1 ',\n"," 'we would definitely be able to tell quickly whether it is there or not ',\n"," 'so we only look at 10 values out of 1000 999 values we do not look at all unlike the ',\n"," 'unsorted case where we have to look at every possible value before we solve ',\n"," 'it is very efficient binary search but it requires us to be able to jump into the ith ',\n"," 'position in constant time therefore if i actually did a binary search on a list even if it is ',\n"," 'sorted and not on an array where i have to start at the 0th position and walk to the ',\n"," 'ith position by following links unfortunately binary search will not give me the expected ',\n"," 'bonus that i get when i use an array ',\n"," 'so having discussed this abstractly we are of course working in the context of pythons ',\n"," 'the question is are built in lists in python are they lists as we have talked about them ',\n"," 'or are they arrays ',\n"," 'actually the documentation would suggest if you look at the python documentation that ',\n"," 'they are lists because you do have these expansion and contraction functions so we saw we can ',\n"," 'do an append or we can do a remove of a value and so on ',\n"," 'they do support these flexible things which are typical of lists however python supports ',\n"," 'this indexed position right so it allows us to look for a to the i ',\n"," 'if you try it out on a large list you will find that it actually does not take that much ',\n"," 'more time to go say it construct a list of a hundred thousand elements you will find ',\n"," 'it takes no more time to go to the last position as to the first position as you would normally ',\n"," 'expect in a list we said that it should take longer to go to the last position ',\n"," 'although they are lists as far as we are concerned we will treat them as arrays when we want ',\n"," 'to and just to emphasise how lists work when we go further in this course we will actually ',\n"," 'look at how to implement some data structures ',\n"," 'and we will see how to explicitly implement a list with these pointers which point from ',\n"," 'one element to another ',\n"," 'for the rest of this course whenever we look at a python list we will kind of implicitly ',\n"," 'use it as an array so when we discuss further sorting algorithms and all that we will do ',\n"," 'the analysis for the algorithms assuming they are arrays we will get give python implementation ',\n"," \"using python's built in list but as far as we are concerned these lists are equivalent \",\n"," 'to arrays for the purpose of this course  ',\n"," 'for many problems we have to search through a set of possibilities in order to find the ',\n"," 'solution ',\n"," 'there is no clear solution that we can directly reach so we have to systematically search ',\n"," 'for it we keep building candidate solutions one step at a time now it might be that the ',\n"," 'solution that we are trying to get does not work so we hit a dead end and then we undo ',\n"," 'the last step and try the next option imagine for instance if you are solving a sudoku ',\n"," 'so you have a grid and then you start filling up things and there are some points you realize ',\n"," 'that there is nothing you can put here then you go back and you have to change something ',\n"," 'you did before so we have to backtrack we have to go forwards trying to solve the ',\n"," 'problem and at some point when we realize that we are stuck we cannot solve the problem ',\n"," 'again we have to go back and change something we have done before and try something else ',\n"," 'one of the classic problems of this kind is called eight queens problem the problem is ',\n"," 'to place 8 queens on a chess board so that none of them attack each other ',\n"," 'now if you have ever played chess you would know that the queen is a very special piece ',\n"," 'it can move any number of squares along a row column or diagonal  for instance if ',\n"," 'we place the queen here in the third row and the third column then it could move anywhere ',\n"," 'upward down the third column anywhere left or right on the third row and along the two ',\n"," 'diagonals on which the square three comma three lies ',\n"," 'since it can move along these columns it can also capture any piece that lies along these ',\n"," 'rows the queen is said to attack all these squares the squares to which the queen can ',\n"," 'move are said to be attacked by the queen so our goal is to place queens so that they ',\n"," 'do not attack each others so if we have a queen here then we cannot put another queen ',\n"," 'in any of the red squares we have to put it somewhere else for instance we could put ',\n"," 'a new queen say for instance here this would be ok or here ',\n"," 'and then it if i put a queen here in turn it will attack more pieces like it will attack ',\n"," 'these squares and you rule out some more options so i will not be able to place queens there ',\n"," 'and so on so we want to see if we can place 8 queens now we cannot place more than 8 ',\n"," 'queens because there are only 8 rows if you place 9 queens 2 will be in the same ',\n"," 'row or the same column and the same column they will have to attack each other so 8 ',\n"," 'is clearly the limit the question is whether we can actually put 8 ',\n"," 'so we can generalize this question and ask not for 8 but n supposing i have a chessboard ',\n"," 'in which there are n rows and n columns can i place n queens on such a chessboard now ',\n"," 'for n equal to one the question is trivial because you only have to put 1 queen on 1 ',\n"," 'square now it is easy to see that n equal to 2 is impossible because if i have 2 squares ',\n"," 'and wherever i put a queen say here it will attack all the remaining squares no matter ',\n"," 'where i put the queen every other square will be on the row column or diagonal of ',\n"," 'that queen and so there is no possibility of putting ',\n"," 'a second queen it turns out that three is also impossible supposing we start by putting ',\n"," 'a queen in the top left corner then we will see that it blocks out the first column the ',\n"," 'first row and the main diagonal this leaves two slots open for the second queen but wherever ',\n"," 'we put whichever of the two we put it will block the other one ',\n"," 'once we put a queen in one of those slots the other one is on the same diagonal and ',\n"," 'there is no free slot for the third queen so just by exhaustive analysis we can show ',\n"," 'that n equal to three is actually impossible for n equal to 4 for 4 a 4 by 4 board it ',\n"," 'does turn out to be possible we should not start at the corner but one of the corners ',\n"," 'supposing we put it in the second column then we get this pattern of block squares ',\n"," 'then we can find an empty slot on the second row right at the end so we put a queen there ',\n"," 'it blocks of certain of some more squares in the last column and in that diagonal but ',\n"," 'this still leaves one slot in the third row unfortunately the third queen does not block ',\n"," 'the last two slot on the fourth row and we have this kind of symmetric pattern where ',\n"," 'everything is one of the corner in which none of the queens attack each other ',\n"," 'now it turns out that once we cross n equal to 4 for 5 6 7 8 you can show that there ',\n"," 'is always a solution possible our task is to find such a solution how do we find a ',\n"," 'solution for n greater than or equal to 4 ',\n"," 'so as you observed the first of first thing you know is that there can be exactly one ',\n"," 'queen in each row and in each column because queens attack the column and row on which ',\n"," 'they lie if we have two queens on the same row or the same column they will necessarily ',\n"," 'attack each other since 8 is the classical size of a chessboard let us look at specifically ',\n"," 'our example for 8 queens so we want to place the queens now row by row we know that there ',\n"," 'is exactly one queen in each row let us first put a queen in the first row ',\n"," 'then based on that put a queen in the second row and so on exactly as we did for the 4 ',\n"," 'by 4 case that we saw in the previous slide so in each row we will place the queen in ',\n"," 'the first available column given the queens that i have already been placed so far by ',\n"," 'available we mean a square which is not attacked so far so we start with an 8 by 8 board ',\n"," 'and in the first row now everything is available by our analysis we are going to put a queen ',\n"," 'in the first available column namely the top left once we do this it blocks out the ',\n"," 'first row and column and the main diagonal so all the shaded squares are now under attack ',\n"," 'we move to the second row and we try to put a queen in the first available column this ',\n"," 'is the third one and this in turn will attack another set of rows columns and diagonal ',\n"," 'squares now we move to the third row and in the 5th ',\n"," 'column we can place a queen and this one again attacks some squares so we have added ',\n"," 'some colors to indicate as each new queen is placed which squares are newly under attack ',\n"," 'by the new queen some of them are attacked by multiple queens for instance the yellow ',\n"," 'queen attacks the blue square on the diagonal which was already attacked by the first queen ',\n"," 'so we will leave it blue for now in this way we can proceed so we put a 4th queen ',\n"," 'on the 4th row and then this is a mistake this should be already attacked by this queen ',\n"," 'and then we will place a 5th queen and then a 6th one and then a 7th one and now we find ',\n"," 'that all the squares in the 8th row are actually blocked there is no way to extend this solution ',\n"," 'to put the 8th queen so we have to do something about this we cannot place a queen in the ',\n"," '8th row ',\n"," 'since we cannot put a place with queen in the 8th row we have to go back and change ',\n"," 'something we did before now the last thing we did was to put the 7th queen right so ',\n"," 'we do that and we find that unfortunately for the 7th queen we had only one choice ',\n"," 'so we have no other choice for the 7th queen though the 7th queen could not lead to a solution ',\n"," 'it was not the choice of the 7th queen which actually made a problem but it was something ',\n"," 'earlier then we go back and try to move the 6th queen ',\n"," 'so once again if you remove the 6th queen then this unblocks a few squares but at the ',\n"," 'same time there was no other place to place the 6th queen on the 6th row so again this ',\n"," 'was a unique choice that we had made now if we go back to the 5th queen then we find ',\n"," 'that there is a way to place the 5th queen in a different place namely it move it to ',\n"," 'this slot so we can move this 5th queen to one slot to the right and try again ',\n"," 'so having gone back from the 8th square and so 8th row which is completely blocked to ',\n"," 'the 7th row which had only one choice to the 6th row which had only one choice we come ',\n"," 'back to the 5th row and now we try the next choice for the 5th row if we try the next ',\n"," 'choice for the 5th row  then we get this pattern of squares and now we see for example ',\n"," 'that we cannot put a 6th thing so both the choices for the 5th row actually turn out ',\n"," 'to be bad so you would now have to go back and try a different choice for the 4th row ',\n"," 'and so on ',\n"," 'this is what backtracking is all about we keep trying to extend the solution to the ',\n"," 'next step if we cannot we undo the previous move and try again and in this way we exhaustively ',\n"," 'search through all the possible solutions but we do it in a systematic way we do not ',\n"," 'go back and randomly reshuffle some of the choices we made before we go back precisely ',\n"," 'one step and undo the previous steps so at each step we have a number of choices ',\n"," 'we go through them systematically for each choice we try to extend the solution if the ',\n"," 'solution does not get extended we come back we try the next choice and when we exhaust ',\n"," 'all choices at this level we report back to the previous level that we have failed then ',\n"," 'they will try their next choice and so on the key to backtracking is to do a systematic ',\n"," 'search through all the possibilities by going forwards and backwards one level at a time ',\n"," 'so how would we actually encode this kind of an approach specifically for the 8 queens ',\n"," 'problem so our first question is how to represent the board because a board is what keeps changing ',\n"," 'as we make moves and undo them the most obvious way for an n queen solution is to represent ',\n"," 'the board literally as an n by n grid and since python numbers list position from 0 ',\n"," 'onwards we have an n by n grid and we number the columns not 1 to n but 0 to n minus 1 ',\n"," 'so will have rows 0 to n minus 1 and columns 0 to n minus 1 we can now put a value 1 or ',\n"," '0 or true or false to indicate whether or not there is a queen at the square i comma ',\n"," 'j i is the row j is the column so we can have a two dimensional list board ',\n"," 'or list of lists which has n minus 1 by n minus 1 0 to n minus 1 and 0 to n minus 1 ',\n"," 'as a valid indices and we say that board i j is 1 to indicate that the queen is at i ',\n"," 'comma j and therefore if it is 0 it indicates there ',\n"," 'is no queen there are two possible values for every square of course we also know ',\n"," 'that there is only one queen per row this particular thing though it has n minus n into ',\n"," 'n n square entries it will only have actually n ones at any given time so we can optimize ',\n"," 'this slightly by just having a single list with the entries 0 to n minus 1 where we say ',\n"," 'that the ith entry corresponds to the ith row and we record the column number so if ',\n"," 'board of i is equal to j it means that in row i the queen is at column j the queen ',\n"," 'is at position i comma j ',\n"," 'so with such a data structure this is the outline of how our strategy works so what ',\n"," 'we have to do is place each queen one at a time so we are just writing a function which ',\n"," 'tries to place a queen in row i given the current state of the board so we pass it ',\n"," 'the current state of the board as one argument and we pass it the row number i that we are ',\n"," 'going to do so we would initially start with an empty board and with row 0 now we ',\n"," 'run through each column and check whether the row column position that is the square ',\n"," 'i comma c is available if it is available we then put a queen there and we of course ',\n"," 'have to update the board so we will come back in a minute but in our case updating ',\n"," 'our board just means setting board i equal to c if we have the one dimensional representation ',\n"," 'now if we have actually put the last queen if i was n minus 1 then this is the last queen ',\n"," 'right so if it is an 8 queen problem then when we have put queen number 7 starting from ',\n"," '0 then we are done so we can return true however if this is not the last queen then ',\n"," 'we have to continue so what we need to do is now with the new board we have to place ',\n"," 'one more queen so we recursively call this function incrementing the row to i plus one ',\n"," 'with the updated board which we have just put and this will return true or false depending ',\n"," 'on whether it succeeds or not so we record it is return value in the name extend solution ',\n"," 'depending on whether it succeeds or not we check if extend solution is true that is the ',\n"," 'current position reaches the end now when would it be true if it succeeded ',\n"," 'in going all the way to level n minus 1 and n minus 1 returns true so when n minus 1 ',\n"," 'returns true then n minus 2 will return true and so on then our level i will also get ',\n"," 'the value true then we can also return true so if extend solution returns true we also ',\n"," 'return true saying that so far i am good on the other hand if extend solution returns ',\n"," 'false it means that given the current position that i chose for row i nothing more could ',\n"," 'be done to extend this to a full solution this position must be undone so we have ',\n"," 'to undo this move so we have to whatever we did earlier to update the board ',\n"," 'this update has to be reversed at this point so we have to reverse the effect of putting ',\n"," 'at i c and then when we do this we will go back and we will try the next c and now if ',\n"," 'we have actually run through all the câ€™s and we have not returned true at any point ',\n"," 'then python has this else which says that the for loop terminated without coming out ',\n"," 'in between the for loop terminates normally it means ',\n"," 'we have run through every possible c that was available and for none of them did we ',\n"," 'return true that means that there is no way to currently put a queen on row i given ',\n"," 'the board that we have so we should return false saying that the board that we got is ',\n"," 'not a good one then the previous row will now get a false and we try the next position ',\n"," 'and so on this is a recursive solution that we get we will see an actual python implementation ',\n"," 'but we have to do a little bit more work to figure out how to actually implement this ',\n"," 'the crucial thing in the implementation that we saw the previous one is that we have to ',\n"," 'update the board when we place the queen and update the board when we undo it and we also ',\n"," 'have to check whether i c is available ',\n"," 'so we had two representations a two dimensional representation with 0s and ones and a one ',\n"," 'dimensional representation which gives us the column position for each row to keep track ',\n"," 'of the queens in the board but in order to determine whether a square is free or not ',\n"," 'we need to have a better way to compute how the squares are attacked by queens ',\n"," 'a simple way would be to just say that along with a two dimensional representation of the ',\n"," 'board we denote like we are done pictorially in the example we worked out we denote by ',\n"," 'what we have called this kind of colored square whether or not an attack a square is attacked ',\n"," 'so we say attack i j is 1 if it is attacked by queen otherwise it is 0 now the problem ',\n"," 'with this is that a given square i j could be attacked by more than one queen right ',\n"," 'so when we undo a queen it will obviously attack many squares but not all those squares ',\n"," 'become free by removing that queen because some of the squares are also attacked by other ',\n"," 'queens which we had placed earlier so we need to be careful when we remove ',\n"," 'a queen in order to mark squares which were attacked as being free well one way to do ',\n"," 'this is to actually number the queens and record the earliest queen that attacks each ',\n"," 'square ',\n"," 'so we say attack i j is k if i j was first attacked by queen k and attack i j is minus ',\n"," 'one if i j is free so when we remove queen k we reset attack i j with value k to minus ',\n"," '1 and all other squares are still attacked by earlier queens ',\n"," 'so we can explain this very easily with the picture that we had before ',\n"," 'here is how we had represented our board when we put the blue queen we marked all squares ',\n"," 'of the blue queen attacked with blue as blue solid squares then when we put the red queen ',\n"," 'we only attack when we mark with red those squares new squares which are attacked for ',\n"," 'example this particular square which is attacked by both red and blue was already ',\n"," 'attacked by blue so we did not mark it so in this way with each new queen i that ',\n"," 'we put we only mark the squares which are attacked by queen i ',\n"," 'the colors here represent the queen numbers the blue squares are queen 0 the red squares ',\n"," 'are queen one the yellow squares are queen two and so on so when it comes to undoing ',\n"," 'it for a instance now we want to undo this particular thing now this when we put it had ',\n"," 'only one white square there was no free squares other than this so we did not add any new ',\n"," 'attack so removing it does not actually change anything regarding the attack position ',\n"," 'only makes that particular square itself free does not unattack any of the other squares ',\n"," 'now when we remove this orange queen then we have to remove all the orange squares which ',\n"," 'were placed under attack only after adding this queen and that turns out to be these ',\n"," 'two on the bottom row so when we undo this one we will find those two get undone similarly ',\n"," 'when we undo the purple so what we are done actually was precisely this more efficient ',\n"," 'implementation of how to keep things how to record what is under attack ',\n"," 'so we are going to now keep an attack array which says that attack i j is k if it is ',\n","
